This plugin allows you to send a range of lines from a buffer to another screen window. This could be used for all sorts of things but my motivation was to be able to edit SQL statements in a file and then send them to a open mysql client session in another window. You could also send ruby code to a running erb or bash commands to a bash prompt, etc. You could even use this as a quick way to paste between 2 vim sessions running in different windows (or even different screen sessions).

The plugin creates some mapping by default. 

In normal mode || sends the current line to another screen window. In visual modes use |.

If you have a mapleader set you'll need to type that first for both mapings. See :help mapleader for more info on that.

You can create you own mappings to override these. For the normal mode do this:

nmap <whatever> <Plug>ScreenPipeSend

For visual modes do this:

vmap <whatever> <Plug>ScreenPipeOpSend

Just replace <whatever> with what you want to map of course.

Finally, this plugin also provides a :ScreenPipe command to do the same thing.

The code is available on git here:

KNOWN BUGS:
1. The window list doesn't show up on the mac (but choosing the right number still works)

TODO:
1. Implement an operator.
